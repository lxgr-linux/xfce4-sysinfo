# xfce4-sysinfo

This piece of software should improve the use of the xfce desktopenvoirement in Arch Linux (I may expand this to other distros).

# dependencies

This script needs gktdialog, zenity, xfce4-session, pacman, egrep, awk, hostname and hostnamectl.


# installation 

This script is standalone usable, but you may copy it to /usr/bin/.
In this case you can call it via 'sysinfo'.
Can also copy the .desktop file to /usr/share/applications to call the script via the xfce menu.
